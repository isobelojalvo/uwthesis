\chapter{Supersymmetry and MSSM}

We have already seen that the the standard model 
performs fantastically well in describing experimental observations. The
recent discovery of a standard model-like higgs boson brings with it
more confidence of the model. Questions arise when this model is seen as 
a part of a grand unified theory.
As seen in the previous chapter, the potential of the standard model higgs 
field (now written in terms of the higgs mass, $m_{h}$) is,
\begin{equation}
V=m_{h}^{2}(\phi)+\lambda(\phi)^{2}
\end{equation}
where $\phi$ is a complex scalar.
The standard model higgs field must have a non-vanishing vacuum expectation 
value of $246 \GeV$ to derive the masses of the W/Z and h.
True problems arise when
considering higher order radiative corrections to the mass of the higgs. For example, 
considering a fermion loop correction seen in figure \ref{fig:fermionLoop}. 
If a fermion couples to the higgs with a term in the Lagrangian $-\lambda_{f}\phi \bar{f}f$
then figure \ref{fig:fermionLoop} 
yields a correction the the higgs mass,
\begin{equation}
\Delta m_{H}^{2}=-\frac{|\lambda_{f}|^{2}}{8\pi^{2}}\Lambda_{UV}^{2}+...
\label{eq:SUS1}
\end{equation}
The loops represent terms which are proportional to $m_{f}^{2}$.
Since the standard model is a renormalizable theory, $\lambda_{f}^{2}$ can
be picked so that $\Lambda_{UV}$ is an ultraviolet cutoff to regulate the loop. 

$\Lambda_{UV}$ is also the energy scale at which new physics should enter.
Accordingly, there are quantum corrections from the radiative
effects of every particle that couples to the higgs. Furthermore if each of these 
particles gain their mass through the higgs mechanism the entire standard model 
mass spectrum is sensitive to the ultraviolet cutoff.

%Since the electroweak gauge bosons, and possibly the quarks and leptons gain their
%mass from the Higgs Mechanism 
However, suppose there exists a massive scalar particle S, mass $m_{S}$, that couples
to the higgs with a term $-\lambda_{S}\phi^{2} S^{2}$
figure \ref{fig:scalarLoop} would give a correction of,
\begin{equation}
\Delta m_{H}^{2}=\frac{\lambda_{s}}{16\pi^{2}}\left[\Lambda_{UV}^{2}-2m_{s}^{2}ln(\Lambda_{UV}/m_{S})+... \right].
\label{eq:SUS2}
\end{equation}
By examining (\ref{eq:SUS1}) and the second term of (\ref{eq:SUS2}) it is apparent that if each of the quarks
and leptons is accompanied by 2 complex scalars the $\Lambda_{UV}^{2}$ terms will cancel.
%This problem is known as the Hierarchy Problem. %%cite

A supersymmetry transformation changes a fermionic state into a bosonic state and vice versa,
\begin{equation}
Q|\mathrm{Boson}\rangle=|\mathrm{Fermion}\rangle \qquad Q|\mathrm{Fermion}\rangle=|\mathrm{Boson}\rangle
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\{Q,Q^{\dagger}\}=p^{\mu}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\{Q,Q\}=\{Q^{\dagger},Q^{\dagger}\}=0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
[p^{\mu},Q ]=[p^{\mu},Q^{\dagger}]=0
\end{equation}

In the simplest supersymmetric extension of the standard model,
this hierarchy problem could be solved by having two higgs doublet 
with an $SU(2)_{L}$ symmetry,
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{1}=
\left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      \phi_{1}^{0*} \\
      -\phi_{1}^{-}
    \end{array}
  \right) 
 \qquad
\Phi_{2}=
\left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      \phi_{2}^{+} \\
      -\phi_{2}^{0}
    \end{array}
  \right) 
\end{equation}
which gives mass to the quarks and charged leptons. The extra doublet
is needed to cancel out the corresponding supersymmetric higgs fermion
contributions.
$H_{1}^{0}$ and $H_{2}^{0}$ acquire vacuum expectation values $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ where
\begin{equation}
v = \sqrt{2}(v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2})^{\frac{1}{2}}.
\end{equation}
The ratios of $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ is traditionally written as,
\begin{equation}
\tan(\beta)=\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}
\end{equation}
%%% something about shifting the neutral scalar fields by their vevs and diagonalization 
%The following higgs boson states are attained
\begin{equation}
\left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      H^{0}_{1} \\
     H^{0}_{2}
    \end{array}
  \right) 
  =
  \sqrt{2}
  \begin{pmatrix}
  \cos{\alpha} & \sin{\alpha}\\
  -\sin{\alpha}& \cos{\alpha}\\
  \end{pmatrix}
\left(
      \begin{array}{c}
      Re{\phi}_{1}^{0*}-v_{1} \\
     Re{\phi}_{2}^{0}-v_{2}
    \end{array}
  \right) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
H_{3}^{0}=\sqrt{2}(\sin{\beta}Im\phi_{1}^{0*}+\cos{\beta}Im\phi^{0}_{2})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
H^{-}=(H^{+})^{*}=-\phi_{1}^{-}\sin{\beta}+\phi_{2}^{-}\cos{\beta}
\end{equation}
In the supersymmetric model the standard model and supersymmetric particles are arranged
into supermultiplets. These supermultiplets must contain both the fermion
and the boson superpartner. In the simplest approach, a  spin $\frac{1}{2}$
weyl fermion (for example, $e$) must have %%%check this
a spin-0 superpartner $\tilde{e}$, likewise, a supermultiplet with a spin-1 vector boson would have
 a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ weyl fermion superpartner.
 If supersymmetry remained unbroken
then $m_{e}=m_{\tilde{e}}$, as sparticles like $\tilde{e}$ have not 
yet been discovered this implies that supersymmetry must be a broken
symmetry.

The MSSM the number of independent parameters can be reduced to 
$\tan{\beta}$ and the mass of the pseudoscalar, $m_{A}$. The masses of the other
neutral bosons are given by,
\begin{equation}
m_{h}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(m_{A}^{2}+M_{Z}^{2}+\left[(m_{A}^{2}+
M_{Z}^{2})^{2}-4M_{Z}^{2}m_{A}^{2}\cos^{2}{(2\beta)}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\right).
\end{equation}
While the masses of the two charged bosons are,
\begin{equation}
m_{H^{\pm}}^{2}=m_{A}^{2}+M_{W}^{2}.
\end{equation}
