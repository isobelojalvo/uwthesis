\section{Hadronic Calorimeter}
The CMS detector is designed to study a wide range of high energy 
physics processes; measurement of hadronic jets and neutrinos or
physics processes which result in missing transverse energy require
a hadronic calorimeter. 
Located outside the Electromagnetic Calorimeter but still within the
superconducting magnet volume is stationed the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL).
The Hadronic Calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter: it consists of layered 
sheets of scintillators interleaved with brass absorber plates. Figure %reference figure for HCAL
shows the placement of the of the four regions of the HCAL, the HCAL Barrel (HB),
the HCAL Endcap (HE), the HCAL Forward (HF) and the outer HCAL (HO). 
%The last of these, the outter HCAL, was not active for the 2011/2012 runs. 
The barrel and endcap HCALs, HB and HE, are located within the 
solenoid magnet. The HB extends across $|\eta|<1.3$ and the HE extends from ___


Due to the technical and environmental demands the HF is based on
Cherenkov Radiationg Quartz technology. The forward region has an overall 
higher particle flux and
