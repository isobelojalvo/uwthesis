\section{Trigger}
The LHC delivers proton-proton collisions at the beam crossing 
interval of 25 ns, this corresponds to a crossing frequency of 40 MHz.
Each interaction, or event, requires 0.5 to 1 megabytes of storage space.

the trigger system is the most important subsystem of CMS. 

The CMS trigger system is divided into two parts: the Level 1 trigger 
and the High Level Trigger (HLT). 
The Level 1 trigger uses coarsely segmented
data from only the calorimeters and the muon system to make initial
data selections while holding high resolution data in pipelined memories
in front-end electronics. 
The Level 1 trigger must reduce rates by at least a factor of 10$^{6}$, 
resulting in a final output of approximately 30kHz,
before high resolution data is passed to the HLT.
