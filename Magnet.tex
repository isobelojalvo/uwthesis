\section{Superconducting Magnet}
When designing a particle detector choice of magnet configuration drives
much of the detector layout and design; large bending power is required to precisely 
measure the momentum of high-energy charged particles. This forced the CMS
collaboration to choose superconducting technology for the magnets.
The superconducting solenoid magnet used in CMS was designed to reach a 4-T field;
during the 2011 and 2012 runs it was operated at a central magnetic flux
density of 3.8-T to reduce the effects of aging on the coil. %%%Cite http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-0221/5/03/T03021/pdf/1748-0221_5_03_T03021.pdf
The purpose of this magnetic field is to allow precise measurement of the 
momentum of charged particles, across a wide range of energies, originating from LHC collisions. 

For a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field the  momentum of the charged particle is given by,
\begin{displaymath}
p=qBr
\end{displaymath}  
Where p is the momentum of the particle, q is its charge, B is the 
magnetic field strength and r is the radius of the particle's trajectory.
The transverse momentum resolution depends on the magnetic field and
solenoid radius as
\begin{displaymath}
\frac{dp}{p}\propto\frac{p}{BL^{2}}
\end{displaymath}
%Therefore, 
%is used for the measurement of track momenta in the tracker 
%and to predict track bendin
%by reconstructing the path of charged particle in the tracker

The super conducting magnet consists of two main parts, the superconducting
solenoid and the return yoke.
Due to structural constraints, the solenoid itself is 6.3m in diameter and 12.5 m in length,
this is large enough to allow the tracker, electromagnetic calorimeter
and the hadronic calorimeter to be contained within the solenoid. This is
a desirable characteristic as it limits the number of radiation
lengths between the nominal collision point and these detectors. The solenoid
is composed of 4 layers of windings due to the large number of ampere-turns required
and is composed of NbTi. The windings and support structure of the solenoid
are detailed in Figure \ref{fig:magnetLayout}. 
The magnetic field is given by,
\begin{displaymath}
B=\mu_{0}nI
\end{displaymath}
where $\mu_{0}$ is the magnetic constant, n is the number of turns per unit length and 
I is the current. 
The flux is returned by a 10,000 ton yoke which is composed of 11 elements, 6 endcap disks 
and 5 barrel wheels. The yoke also was designed to contain four muon stations. 
Both the solenoid and the yoke also serve a dual purpose as a structural support 
for the CMS experiment.
