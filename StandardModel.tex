The Standard Model of particle physics follows an %%%

\subsection{The Standard Model Lagrangian}%%%Change name?
Here we describe the logic behind the formulation of the Standard Model theory. %%%FIX
In classical mechanics Lagrange's equation of motion are used to
describe the motion of any %%check/reference goldstein
Extending this to a wave function with continuously varying coordinates $\psi(\bold{x},t)$
where \bold{x} is the spatial coordinates and t is time.
In this regime, the Lagrangian equation of motion becomes
\frac{\partial}{\partialx_{\mu}}\(\frac{\symL}{\partial\(\partial\psi/\partialx_{\mu}\)}\)-\frac{\partial\symL}{\psi}
%%equation 
And, following the standard, $\symL$ is referred to as the Lagrangian
despite it actually being the Lagrangian density,
.%%%equation 
As was stated in section XXX,%ref StandardModel Section 1
To derive the Lagrangians for the SM we start by stating
the Feynman rules:
