\section{Muon System}
Good muon detection and resolution is of central importance 
to the CMS detector due it's appearance in the final state of many important processes
(for example H$\rightarrow$ZZ$\rightarrow\mu\mu$ and H$\rightarrow\tau\tau$ 
with $\tau\rightarrow\mu\overbar{\nu_{\mu}}\nu_{\tau}$). 
The muon is a relatively easy particle to detect due to its long life time 
and heavy mass they are less affected by radiative losses and the
CMS detector is capable of measuring muon momemntum over the entire
kinematic range of the LHC.
