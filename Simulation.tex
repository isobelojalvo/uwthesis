%Say something about simulation of hard processes
We wish to use an event generator which produces hypothetical events with a distribution
that is predicted by theory.
%list issues
It is easiest to address these issues by considering the simulation of 
the process $W\rightarrow\mu\nu$. 
\begin{equation}
d\sigma(u\bar{d}\rightarrow W^{-}\rightarrow \mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}})
=\frac{1}{2\hat{s}}|\mathcal{M}(u\bar{d}\rightarrow W^{-}\rightarrow \mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}})|^{2}
\frac{d\cos\theta d\phi}{8(2\pi)^{2}}
\label{eq:matrixEle}
\end{equation}
where the decay angles $(\theta,\phi)$ of the $W^{-}$ are the two degrees of
freedom of the problem. $\mathcal{M}$ is the relevant matrix element and $\hat{s}$
is the center of mass energy squared.
%In typical event generators which simulate hard processes 
%ref equation
Equation (\ref{eq:matrixEle}) is used to write an event generator. 
To do this first a sampling of the relevant phase
space must be done using a random number generator, next the events must
be unweighted using the hit-and-miss technique to produce events with observables. %%this is terrible
The relevant phase space for this process is two dimensional: -1 < $cos\theta$ < 1,
0 < $\phi$<2$\pi$. The values of $cos\theta$ and $\phi$ can be chosen using
a uniform random number generator. 
Evaluating the equation (\ref{eq:matrixEle}) at $d\sigma(\theta_{i},\phi_{i})$ gives
that candidate event's differential cross section which is equivalent to the 
probability of this event occurring. The average of many candidate event's differential
cross section, $\langle d\sigma\rangle$, is an approximation to $\int d\sigma$ and converges
to the measured cross section.
