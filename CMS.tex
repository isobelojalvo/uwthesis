\chapter{The Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment}
Located on the french side of the LHC ring at interaction Point 5, a few miles from the 
Jura mountains, is the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Detector. 
The CMS detector is located on the LHC ring and therefore must be designed to
operate at %%fix
a center of mass energy of 14 TeV and _____ bunch crossings which cause high pileup.

Furthermore, the CMS detector was designed to mee the following requirements,
Good measurement of track $p_T$ and 

Another important and unique aspect of CMS is its moving-ring-based structure,
allowing for very good access to the detector elements for maintenance and upgrade.

These design aspects has forced the individual subdetectors to support designs which
are able to withstand a large magnetic field, on the order of a few Tesla, and (depending on their location)
are able to withstand large doses of radiation (i.e are radiation hard).
